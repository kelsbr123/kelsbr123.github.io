          <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
          <p>The creators of this content do not endorse any violation of KNC regulations or state or federal law.
            The creators of this content have made every effort to be accurate and truthful in its presentation.</p>
          <h1>Goal</h1>
          <p>Our goal is to reduce the amount of tax that property owners in Keystone pay by dissolving or changing the Keystone Neighborhood Company, also known as KNC. KNC extracts fees from KNC owners while
            providing far too little in return. Now with the incorporation of Keystone, KNC is not necessary.</p>
