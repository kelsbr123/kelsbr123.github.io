          <h1>Goal</h1>
          <p>Our goal is to reduce the amount of tax that property owners in Keystone pay by dissolving or changing the Keystone Neighbourhood Company, also known as KNC. KNC extracts fees from KNC owners while
            providing far too little in return. Now with the incorporation of Keystone, KNC is not necessary.</p>
